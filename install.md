# Installation instructions:
Tested on Ubuntu 24.04, but should work on other Linux too and on Windows if you already have a recent Python3 install (v3.10+)

0. create clean directory
```
mkdir fractalCortex
cd fractalCortex
```

1. Download Git source and unzip here or use 
```
git clone https://github.com/fractalrobotics/Fractal-Cortex.git 
```
Note: if you are in Linux or MacOs, you will need a patched version from my fork instead, if it has not been merged yet in the official release: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jcugnoni/Fractal-Cortex.git
```

2. create Python3 venv
```
cd Fractal-Cortex
cd fractal-cortex
python3 -m venv fractalCortexVenv
```

3. using Python3 from Venv : install dependencies (fix documentation: many more modules are also required, see 2nd line below!)
```
fractalCortexVenv/bin/python3 -m pip install numpy==1.26.4 numpy-stl==3.1.1 pyglet==1.5.28 pyOpenGL==3.1.0 shapely==2.0.4 trimesh==4.3.1 glooey==0.3.6 

fractalCortexVenv/bin/python3 -m pip install scipy rtree mapbox_earcut manifold3d
```
   
4. execute slicer:
```
fractalCortexVenv/bin/python3 slicer_main.py
```
--- patching for case sensitive OS (Linux ; MacOs):

if using the official version of Fractal Cortex code released before this fork changes are commited, you will need to patch the following files:
